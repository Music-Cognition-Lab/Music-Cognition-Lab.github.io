### About us

Research at the Music Cognition Lab seeks to understand the way in
which human <strong>listeners</strong> and <strong>performers</strong>
<strong>perceive</strong> and <strong>appreciate</strong>
<strong>music</strong>. This research spans a wide range of
<strong>psychological domains</strong>, from <strong>low-level
processes</strong> such as auditory stream segregation to
<strong>high-level musical experiences</strong> such as aesthetic
appreciation. The group makes use of a wide range of research
paradigms, including <strong>computational modelling</strong>,
<strong>neuroimaging</strong>, and <strong>cognitive
psychology</strong>.
