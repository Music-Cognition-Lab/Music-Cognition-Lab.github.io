<h4>International Conference of Students of Systematic Musicology (SysMus 2017), September 13-15th 2017, Queen Mary University of London</h4>
<hr>
<p>The tenth anniversary conference in this series was hosted by the Music Cognition Lab at Queen Mary University of London. Details are available here: <a href="https://sysmus17.qmul.ac.uk/">https://sysmus17.qmul.ac.uk/</a>.</p>


<h4>Workshop on Auditory Neuroscience, Cognition and Modelling (WANCM 2016), Wed February 17th 2016, Queen Mary University of London</h4>
<hr>
<p>The workshop brings together cognitive scientists, neuroscientists and computer scientists working on sound and music processing, as well as researchers from related fields. In particular, we are interested in fostering interdisciplinary collaborations between psychologists and neuroscientists studying auditory perception and computer scientists and engineers engaged in auditory modelling and signal processing. New insights on the computational, cognitive and neural underpinnings of speech, music and sound processing will be presented, with a focus on EEG and MEG data analysis. The workshop will provide an opportunity for researchers to gain a deeper understanding of current research methods and to foster multidisciplinary collaborations.</p>
<p>Keynote speakers include Dr Richard E. Turner (University of Cambridge), Dr. Jean-Julien Aucuturier (IRCAM) and Prof. Elvira Brattico (Aarhus University).</p>

<h4>Symposium on Music Cognition at the 31st Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society, August 2013, Humboldt University, Berlin</h4>
<hr>
<p>Many approaches have been taken to modelling the large variety of different cognitive processes involved in music perception and creation involving various modules of basic structural processing, statistical learning, memory, as well as motor, emotional and social cognitive processes. Recent computational models range from hierarchical, rule-based systems for representing harmonic movement inspired by probabilistic grammars for language, through oscillator based network models for modelling metrical and tonal perception, to probabilistic methods derived from machine learning for modelling dynamic learning and predictive processing of style-specific musical structure. Turning to cognitive neuroscience, recent years have seen increasing interest in advanced computational modelling of EEG and fMRI data used to distinguish brain regions responsible for the processing of different aspects of music (e.g., rhythm, pitch, timbre, harmony) and the functional connectivity between them. The purpose of this symposium is to bring together and display current research trends towards a synthesis of these two research areas linking the parameters and subcomponents of cognitive models of musical processing to functional and anatomical properties of the brain.</p>

<h4>Workshop on Information Dynamics of Music, Thu 21 March 2013, Goldsmiths University of London</h4>
<hr>
<p>A workshop to celebrate the successful research project Information and Neural Dynamics in the Perception of Musical Structure funded by the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC). The project includes members at Queen Mary, University of London and Goldsmiths, University of London. The workshop will address dynamic predictive processing of musical structure in: i) probabilistic and information theoretic models; ii) cognitive, psychological and neural processing; iii) musicological analysis. The keynote speakers were:</p>
