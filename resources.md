### Lab Resources

<ul>
<li><a href="https://osf.io/m7wzn/">Music Cognition Lab OSF</a>: open-acccess data, analysis scripts and other resources.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Music-Cognition-Lab">Music Cognition Lab Github</a>: open-access software and code written by lab members.</li>
</ul>

### Join the lab

We welcome applications for post-doctoral research within the
lab. Some relevant fellowship schemes can be found <a
href="http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/fellowships.html">here.</a>

Prospective PhD students interested in doing research on music
perception and cognition should contact Marcus Pearce in the first
instance including a CV and a brief description of their research
interests. Funding for doctoral research is periodically available and
will be announced here and on <a
href="http://www.jobs.ac.uk">www.jobs.ac.uk</a> and other relevant
mailing lists.

The <a href="http://aim.qmul.ac.uk/">UKRI Doctoral Centre for Training
in Music and Artificial Intelligence</a> provides funded opportunities
for PhD students to join the Music Cognition Lab for their doctoral
research.

Students on several MSc programmes at Queeen Mary, University of
London may do their summer research projects on Music Perception and
Cognition, supervised by members of the lab including especially the <a
href="http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/postgraduate/programmes/pg-courses/129308.html">MSc
in Sound &amp; Music Computing</a>.

Internships are available periodically for particular research projects.
